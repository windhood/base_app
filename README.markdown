Integrate with Devise.

The project should be ready to use now, for the most part. When you rename your project, however, be sure to rename the module name in all of the configuration files as well. By default the module is called ‘DeviseBase’. DeviseBase is referenced in the following files:

config/application.rb
config/environment.rb
config/environments/development.rb
config/environments/production.rb
config/environments/test.rb
config/initializers/rspec_generator.rb
config/routes.rb
config.ru
