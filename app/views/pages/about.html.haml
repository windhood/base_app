  Haml is a markup language that's used to cleanly and simply describe
  the HTML of any web document without the use of inline code. Haml
  functions as a replacement for inline page templating systems such as PHP,
  ASP, and ERB, the templating language used in most Ruby on Rails
  applications. However, Haml avoids the need for explicitly coding
  HTML into the template, because it itself is a description of the HTML,
  with some code to generate dynamic content.

  ## Core Principles

  Haml's development as a language is based on adherence to several core
  principles. These are:

  Markup should be beautiful
  : Markup should not be used **merely**
    as a tool to get browsers to render a page how the author wants it
    rendered. The rendering isn't the only thing people have to see;
    they have to see, modify, and *understand*
    the markup as well. Thus, the markup should be just as user-friendly
    and pleasant as the rendered result.

  Markup should be <acronym title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</acronym>
  : HTML involves major repetition. Every element is named twice: once
    before its content and once after. ERB adds even more repetition
    and unnecessary characters. HAML avoids all of this by relying on
    indentation, not text, to determine where elements and blocks of
    code begin and end. Not only does this result in smaller templates,
    it makes the code much cleaner to look at.

  Markup should be well-indented
  : One of the major problems with ERB is that not only does it not
    encourage well-indented code, it actively makes it challenging, or
    even impossible, to write. This leads to confusing, unreadable HTML,
    when it should be well indented and reflecting the underlying
    structure of the document. Haml automatically properly formats all
    tags to that it does.

  HTML structure should be clear
  : XML and HTML are formats built upon the idea of a structured document.
    That structure is reflected in their markup, and it should likewise
    be reflected in meta-markup such as Haml Because Haml's logic is based
    on indentation of child elements, this structure is naturally preserved,
    making the document much easier and more logical for mere humans to
    read.

  ## History

  Haml was created because Hampton got really annoyed having to keep hand-typing out templates.
  So many advances have been made in web-development, but the template has remained the same.
  Time for something new.

  Based on those frustrations, Haml was born as an experiment. However, Haml quickly
  proved itself in several production-level websites created at [Unspace Interactive](http://www.unspace.ca).
  In fact, the entire company's development team quickly shrugged off ERB completely
  and have gone entirely to Haml based development.

  Haml quickly proved itself to be a productivity boon.
  Also, designers love Haml for its similarities to CSS.

  Things are better in web development land since Haml arrived.

  ## The Haml Team

  Haml was originally created by **[Hampton Catlin](http://hamptoncatlin.com)**.
  He and [Nathan Weizenbaum](http://nex-3.com) designed Haml through version 2.0.
  Hampton lives in Jacksonville, Florida and is the lead mobile developer for Wikimedia.

  [Nathan Weizenbaum](http://nex-3.com) is now the primary designer of Haml,
  and has been the main developer since its inception.
  He lives in Seattle, Washington and will be going to work for Google
  once he finishes his last year at the University of Washington.
